The Firebase SDK's `onAuthStateChanged` listener might not trigger immediately after a successful sign-in or sign-out. This can lead to inconsistencies in UI updates or data fetching that depends on the authentication state.  For example, if you try to access user data in a componentDidMount() lifecycle method before `onAuthStateChanged` has completed, you might get `null` or an undefined user object, leading to errors or unexpected behavior.
