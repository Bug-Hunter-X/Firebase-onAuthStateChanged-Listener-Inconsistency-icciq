This repository demonstrates a common, yet subtle bug related to Firebase's `onAuthStateChanged` listener. The listener might not fire immediately upon authentication changes, leading to unexpected behavior in your application.  The `firebaseBug.js` file showcases the problem, while `firebaseBugSolution.js` provides a robust solution using promises and async/await to ensure that authentication state is properly handled before accessing user data.
